## Overview

**3DXONE** is a feature-packed overlay and companion app designed specifically for 3DXChat, a leading virtual world platform. Its primary goal is to enhance user engagement by providing tools for event discovery, creative content sharing, and streamlined community interactions. Built with client-side privacy in mind, 3DXONE serves as an independent yet deeply integrated extension for virtual world users.

## Key Features

- **Event Management Overlay**: Displays real-time event schedules from community hubs like [BunnyBot](https://bunnybot.web.app/), ensuring users never miss an important gathering.

- **Symbol Menu Integration**: Provides a convenient dropdown menu for inserting platform-supported symbols directly into chat input fields, enhancing user expression.

- **Marketplace**: Features a categorized marketplace for virtual world assets, allowing users to browse, share, and purchase items.

- **Content Creator Tools**: A seamless system for creators to upload and manage their builds, empowering them to showcase and distribute their work within the community.

- **Discord News Integration**: Fetches live updates from Discord channels using `discord.js` and Open Graph Scraper, keeping users informed about the latest happenings.

- **User-Centric Design**: Developed with an intuitive and professional UI that prioritizes accessibility and user experience.

## Technologies Used

- **Electron**: For building a lightweight, cross-platform desktop application.
- **React and Next.js**: For creating modular and responsive user interfaces.
- **CSS/SCSS**: For designing dynamic and visually appealing layouts.
- **Discord.js**: To fetch live updates and integrate news from Discord channels.
- **Open Graph Scraper**: For enriching content dynamically with metadata.
- **Express.js**: Backend API for managing marketplace data and file uploads.

## Challenges and Learnings

- **Third-Party Data Integration**: Ensuring smooth and reliable integration with platforms like BunnyBot and Discord while maintaining data accuracy.
  
- **Client-Side Functionality**: Since 3DXONE operates independently of 3DXChatâ€™s backend, it required creative approaches to achieve seamless client-side functionality.

- **Scalability and Modularity**: Designed the app to support additional features, such as expanded marketplace categories and enhanced customization.

- **Privacy and Security**: Prioritized user data security by avoiding intrusive server-side dependencies, ensuring a safe and private user experience.

## Outcome

**3DXONE** has become a vital tool for 3DXChat users, enabling them to discover events, enhance their interactions, and contribute creatively to the platform. It has reduced the friction of managing in-world activities and allowed users to engage more meaningfully with the community. Ongoing development will further expand its features, making it even more integral to the virtual world experience.
