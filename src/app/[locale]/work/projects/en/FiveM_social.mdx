## Overview

**FiveM.social** is an online platform built to serve the expansive FiveM roleplay community. It connects players, server owners, and content creators, providing a centralized hub for roleplay interactions, server discovery, and resource sharing. By addressing the gaps in communication and collaboration within the FiveM ecosystem, this project has revolutionized how players engage with their favorite servers and communities.

## Key Features

  A curated directory of roleplay servers, complete with descriptions, tags, and player reviews, helping users find servers that match their interests.

  Personalized user profiles where players can showcase their roleplay characters, achievements, and favorite servers.

  Allows users to connect, form groups, and share updates directly within the platform.

## Technologies Used

## Challenges and Learnings

- **Scalability**:  
  Designing the platform to handle thousands of concurrent users required careful optimization of database queries and server-side logic.

  Balancing the needs of players, server owners, and creators involved iterating on feature requests and incorporating feedback.

- **Data Security**:  
  Protecting user accounts and marketplace transactions demanded robust authentication and encryption protocols.

  Seamlessly connecting with FiveM server APIs to fetch live player counts and server data posed unique challenges that were overcome with creative API usage.

## Outcome
