Built on Unreal Engine, it aimed to move beyond the traditional adult gaming model by focusing on social interaction, detailed environments, and player-driven customization. 

The project received significant interest for its innovation and unique features, but development is currently on hold due to limited resources and the challenge of assembling a dedicated team.
